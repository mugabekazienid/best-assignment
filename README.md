1. What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. This can include information about the program's operation, state, errors, and user activities. Logs are typically written to a file or another output medium for later analysis.

2. Why Logging is Important
Logging is crucial for several reasons:

Debugging: Helps identify and troubleshoot issues in the code.
Monitoring: Allows monitoring of the application's behavior in real-time or over a period.
Auditing: Provides a historical record of user activities and system operations.
Error Tracking: Captures errors and exceptions that occur during the application's runtime.
Performance Tuning: Helps in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing the application.
3. Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels help categorize log messages based on their severity or importance:

TRACE: Fine-grained informational events useful for debugging.
DEBUG: Informational events that are useful for debugging.
INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
WARN: Potentially harmful situations.
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
FATAL: Severe error events that will lead the application to abort.
